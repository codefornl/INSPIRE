## PoC Workshop

Repository: https://github.com/codefornl/INSPIRE-coverages

Thats the Main page voor INSPIRE-coverages with info and pictures.
It wille be used this will be used to decide on the final date for the workshop

We would like to invite you to take note of our experiences.

Time period to Doodle the workshop (yes,no,may be)
# Wednesday- or thursdayafternoon on  17 - 18 - 24 or 25 november
Online

# Purpose
Sharing the results and experiences with the INSPIRE GoodPractice Coverages.
We will show and interact the results and a bit of use. The promairy focus will be on support the provision.

# Target audience
Current providers, not users. 
Team members Data-providers (AHN, Bathymetry, WaterInfo, orthofoto's e.a. uit Duitsland, BelgiÃ«, Luxemburg)
Team members INSPIRE-services RWS (RWS, Sweco, WetRansform, PDOK)
Team members INSPIRE operationeel overleg (MinBzK, MinIenW)
Gebruikers en studenten grensoverschrijdende raster en sensor data (Copernicus, SeadataNed, OSPAR, ISRIC, ...)

# Explanation
Raster data (coverages) are extremely important to spatially analyze dynamic phenomena such as soilchanges, floading, noise pollution.
To do this across international borders, an INSPIRE GoodPractice coverages was established at the beginning of 2021. In order to bring the experts together and get to know the process, the components and the issues, a Proof off Concept (PoC) has been carried out since September.

# PoC
The PoC INSPIRE Goodpractivce Coverages includes the INSPIRE compliant provision of grid and if possible sensor data.
There is knowledge and experience gained with the collecting, conversion and publication of the coverage data. 

In the PoC we process AS-IS data from the source into the data as defined by INSPIRE. 
In the data we distinguish bathymetry, altitude and water quality and water quantity related data.

Expected results are:
- Process
- Experiences
- Issues and solutions
- INSPIRE Goodpractice compliant services

# Participants
The following parties are participating in the chain: JRC, MinBzK, Geonovum, INSPIRE operational consultation, Sweco, DataCov, WetRansform, PDOK and Rijkswaterstaat.
