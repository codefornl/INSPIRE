# PoC Workshop

Time period to Doodle the workshop
# Wednesday- or thursdayafternoon on  17 - 18 - 24 or 25 november


Clear that not on the 20th of Oktober, will be either the week before or after

Current providers, not users. Will show a bit of use, but focus will be on provision

Waiting for new repository on codefornl, INSPIRE-Coverage. Once that is provided, will do the main page there with info and pictures
this will be used to decide on the final date for the workshop
